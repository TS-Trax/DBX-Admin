# This is a comment. All config values are listed as key=value. 
# The script will: 
## 1. Ignore commented lines(start with '#') and new lines 
## 2. Split only on the first occurrence of the character "=". Therefore any characters can be used in the value field
## 3. Remove space characters from the beginning and end of the entries. Therefore "VARIABLE=VALUE" and "VARIABLE = VALUE" will return the same.
## 4. Pick up all key-value pairs listed and create corresponding PS variables name-value
## 5. Support the use of wildcards: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_wildcards?view=powershell-7.1
