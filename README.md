### Motivation
Provide an effective and extensible GUI for administrating & auditing Databricks (DBX) Workspaces, in order to ease user administration and DBX jobs/clusters oversight.

### License
**GNU GPLv3** lets people do almost anything they want, _except distributing closed source versions_, as sharing improvements on this tool would be useful to everyone. 
 
### Advantages
Easier and speedier DBX admin tasks, such as:
- Finding/Adding/Removing users, including across workspaces. 
- Adding/Removing groups, including across workspaces. Copying groups with all their users to other workspaces.
- Monitoring all the cluster states and providing actions like Start/Restart/Stop/Delete clusters. Copying librairies from one cluster to another.
- Detecting orphaned users that do not belong to any group, and correct (either add to an existing group or remove)
- Allows cross-subscription and cross-workspace administration & oversight, e.g. running clusters, job failures, VM types & DBX Runtime used.
- Scales with the number of subscriptions, workspaces etc.
- Dynamic and independent from the number of subscriptions, workspaces, groups, users and clusters â€“ makes minimal assumptions
- Secured via Azure AD login and Key Vault.
- Adaptable via configuration, i.e. specify Key Vault where secret DBX tokens are stored, Workspace list filters, etc.

### Real world scenarios
DBX-Admin has been used in several real-world use cases, like:
#### User administration
- Add a new Data Scientist to all the corresponding groups in the different environments (Dev,Test, Prod)
- Add a group of new Analysts on the project in all the corresponding groups and environments

Instead of having to login to each workspace to add/remove each group or user, the tool will insert/remove in bulk, and in seconds.
#### Cluster/Jobs/VMs/Runtimes monitoring
- Generate an audit report in MS Word (or plain text) of the results obtained below in all or subset (e.g., only prod) of workspaces:
   - Provide a list of clusters running at this time, per workspace
   - List all cluster/job failures per workspace
   - List all the different VM types used per workspace
   - List all the different DBX runtime versions used per workspace

### Present day limitations
- Works only with MS Azure cloud 
- Works with DBX tokens only
- Works with only two Azure regions at a time
- The UI is mostly single-threaded, as secondary WPF windows need to be closed before switching back to the main window. That said, Powershell grid-views are being used wherever they make sense to address that particular limitation. Multi-threading is also being added to parts of the code needing instant refreshing (e.g. color change when cluster state  changes from stopped to started and vice-versa). 
- The tool is limited by the capabilites of the DBX REST API and Powershell. 

### Credits
This tool uses a couple of existing open-source Powershell DBX modules:
- [DataThirstLtd](https://github.com/DataThirstLtd/azure.databricks.cicd.tools)
- [gbrueckl](https://github.com/gbrueckl/Databricks.API.PowerShell)

### Prerequisites
- The tool uses Azure AD login, so the user should have the required permissions to view the subscriptions, workspaces, etc.
- The tool uses DBX tokens, therefore there is still a manual step of getting those tokens and storing them in an Azure Key Vault, where the tool will look for them on startup.

### Design
The DBX-Admin tool uses Powershell, Azure Key Vault, WPF/XAML and a couple existing DBX modules that call the DBX Rest API. It is designed merely to complement the DBX UI, not to replace it.

The general design can be viewed in a tree-like manner, coming down from Azure subscriptions to DBX workspaces, clusters/jobs, groups and users:

Finally, this tool was designed to be simple to use. Tool tips are available at various places in the UI to help. Button labels in brown reddish color indicate cross-workspace operations from the Main window. Other actions are workspace-specific.

_Caching_ happens in a number of places to speed up retrieval. It is still minimized since the tool needs to be as dynamic/real-time as possible.

### Quickstart
1. Create the DBX tokens of the workspaces to administrate
2. Store the tokens in an Azure key vault following the naming convention _\<workspace name\>-tk_ as key vault secret keys.
3. Edit _files/dbx-admin-config.txt_ by entering the Key Vault name, workspace filters regex and the Azure regions.
4. Start the tool by running the main file _dbx-admin.ps1_ with Powershell. 

The DBX-Admin Azure login has two modes: prod (default) & dev, controlled by the internal flag _$IS_DEV_, set in  _dbx-admin.ps1_ . In prod mode, the Login to Azure window will popup everytime the tool is started. In Dev mode, the user login context is saved locally, so as to avoid login everytime the tool intitiates. If the user password is changed however, the tool would need to switch temporarily to prod, to force the new login. Once this is done, the switch back to dev mode will save the new context locally. 
  
**Note**: The start up process will be slow, specially the first time, since missing modules will need to be installed by the tool if not present. Subsequent starts will be faster, though the tool will still need to retrieve the tokens from the key vault each time it starts.


### Example usage #1: Add a new Data Scientist to the corresponding groups in all selected workspaces
Here, we could just enter the user email _some.ds@domain.com_ in the text box and click on the different workspaces, adding that user everytime.

Although this is faster than performing a login in each workspace to add that user, there is still a simpler and faster way to do this, by using 'Bulk Operations'.
First, we can do a quick check on an existing Data Scientist memberships by using the cross-workspace 'Find' feature:

<img width="422" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97665470/149615699-59b37394-1e12-430c-a4cd-044937383e7e.png">


We can see that the DS groups are spelled slightly differently. This happens often in the real-world, so the tool needs to find a way to still match those group names when performing a _bulk Add_ operation. The way it does that is by using **fuzzy-matching** using a group pattern in the 'Bulk Operations' window:

<img width="516" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97665470/149615182-bb1aff0c-ea55-4fe6-ac61-54d10fca2a89.png">

The tool will fuzzy-match the group pattern 'Data Scientist' with 'Data Scientists', 'data scientist' and 'data science'. Where there is no fuzzy match, the workspace is simply skipped. The _bulk Add_ will only take a few seconds to perform the task.


### Example usage #2: Add a group of new Analysts to the corresponding groups in all selected workspaces
This is similar to the previous scenario, as it uses the 'Bulk Operations' window. Only in this case, we're adding a whole group of users at the same time. The only prerequisite to perform this task is to have previously set up a simple text file with one user per line. In the 'Group' tab, we use the 'Load File' button to get those users. 

<img width="457" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97665470/149616265-c0ec8f83-cd12-4423-9dc7-ae225828ec53.png">

The bulk 'Add' operation will fuzzy-match the group entered with existing ones. The operation will only take seconds.

### Example usage #3: Generate a global report that includes cluster running in Production, with job failures, used VM types and runtime versions
This is yet another case where the 'Bulk Operations' window comes in handy. We first use the Inlcude/Exclude filters to get the list of workspaces we want to investigate. We then run the checks in the corresponding tabs, e.g. for the Runtime tab:

When done with the checks, we can summarize all the results by using the 'Generate Report', where we can choose the file format (Text or MS Word). The tool will automatically detect the content and check the corresponding boxes. If for instance we only checked for running clusters and runtime versions, we will get the following window:

<img width="441" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97665470/149616918-44f2497c-74f0-4c85-87c8-8cb626d11058.png">

We can then send that audit report to whoever has requested it.
